Hello! Welcome to My Cool Music Player! Please add some songs to the assets directory to get started. My Cool Music Player will then pull the metadata from your songs (artist, title, duration) and display them in a list. Then, please click/tap a song to play it. It will then take you to a Now Playing screen showing enhanced detail about the song. This screen also shows the volume slider and the song that is up next. There is a pause/play button on both the Home screen and Player screen for your convenience. Both screens also have "Previous" and "Next" buttons so you can search for your favorite song with ease. The Player screen has a feature to choose how you'd like to loop your music-- One to hear the same song on repeat, All to play through all of the songs in your library, and None to stop playing music all together once you've reached the end of your catalog. You can click the Back button to return to the Home screen that shows your list of songs at any time. While on the Home screen, the top bar will display the currently playing song, and you can click that to go back to the song details, looping, volume, and see what is going to play next. The app has a fun 50s retro theme with bright reds and blues against dark backgrounds, the colors really pop just how they looked in the hay day of rock n roll.
